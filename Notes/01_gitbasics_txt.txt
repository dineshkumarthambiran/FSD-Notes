Learning Objectives 26th July 2022:

	- git basics
	- git architecture
	- git operations


What is git?

	- Source Code Management
	- Version Controlling System
	- Invented by Linus Torvalds (Who invented Linux OS)
	- Open Source
	- Set of commands


Steps to push the local repo to git remote repo:

	- Make a local git repo (Converted into a git repo)
		- git init
		
	- Add remote origin
		- Telling the final destination
		- git remote add origin "url of the remote repo"		

	- Move the changes to the staging area
	- Move the changes from staging area to commit history
	- From commit history push the changes to rit remote




Before doing git commands the username and email has to be configured:


To convert a local folder into a git repo:

	- git init

To tell the final destination(Remote repo):

	- git remote add origin remote repo url

To move a changes on a particular file from local git repo to the staging area:

	- git add file_name

To move all the changes from local git repo to the staging area:

	- git add .

To move all the changes from staging area to the commit history:

	- git commit -m "<File name> Meaningfull commit message"

To push from commit history to git remote account:

	- git push -u origin master


To see all the commits with their commit id and commit messages:

	- git log

To remove a particular commit -> get the commit id and then "git reset <commit id>"

===============================================================================================================


git pull
	- Is a process of getting the copy of the project components 
	- .git folder is not downloaded along with the project content hence other configuration information will be missing
	- Because we don't get the configurations, need to add the remote orgins

git clone
	- Is a process of getting the copy of the complete project including the complete project structure
	- .git folder is also downloaded along with all the other configuration information
	- Because we get all thge configurations, no need to add the remote orgins
	- Once a repo is cloned then it can easily pulled with git pull command
	
forking
	- Is a process of getting the copy of the repo into our remote gitlab account

git branches
	- Seeing the branches in our repo
	- Create a branch
	- Merging a branch
	- Deleting a branch


To see log messages of a specific branch:

	git log master..branchname
