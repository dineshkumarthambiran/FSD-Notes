Learning Objectives 29th Sep 2022:

	- Adding a column
	- Removing a column
	- Adding a constraint
	- Removing a constraint
	- order by
	- like


Renaming the column:

	- ALTER TABLE employee RENAME COLUMN oldname TO newname;

Adding a column:

	- ALTER TABLE employee ADD city VARCHAR(30);	

Removing a column:

	- ALTER TABLE employee DROP city;

Adding a constraint:

	- ALTER TABLE employee MODIFY name VARCHAR(35) NOT NULL;
	- CREATE TABLE employee (sid INT, sname VARCHAR(30), age INT, CONSTRAINT chk_age CHECK (age>18));

Alter table:

	- ALTER TABLE employee ADD CHECK (sid>10);
	- ALTER TABLE employee ADD CONSTRAINT chk_sid CHECK (sid>10 AND sname='Janaki');
	- ALTER TABLE employee DROP CONSTRAINT chk_sid;

Order by:

	- SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY age;
	- SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY age, city DESC;

Like:

	- Used to create pattern for selecting the result:
	- % -> Is used to denote any character and no of characters

	SELECT * FROM employees WHERE city like '%i'; ---> Fetches the records of cities that are ending with the letter i
	SELECT * FROM employees WHERE city like 'D%i'; ---> Fetches the records of cities that are staring with the letter D and ending with the letter i
	SELECT * FROM employees WHERE city like '%h%i'; ---> Fetches the records of cities that are starting with any no of characters, having the letter h in the middle and ending with the letter i


Updating a record in a tables:

	- Updating a record is a DML Query
	- UPDATE table_name SET colname1=value, colname2=value WHERE condition;

	UPDATE employees SET city = 'Coimbatore', age = 27 WHERE city='Chennai';


Deleting a record or records from table:

	- It is a DML command
	- DELETE will help to delete a particular record from the table
	- DELETE will not change the table structure as DROP does

	DELETE FROM employees WHERE city = 'Mumbai';
	DELETE FROM employee;


DROP vs DELETE:

	- When a table is deleted the data can be retrieved back (Using some backup mechanism)
		- Retains the structure of the table
	- When it is dropped the entire structure of the table is removed from the memory along with the data of the table

DROP TABLE tablename;
DROP DATABASE dbname;
