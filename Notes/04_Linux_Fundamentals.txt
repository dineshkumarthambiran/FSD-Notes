Learning Objectives 28th July 2022 - AN:

	- find operation
	- filter operation


finding a file or directory:

find path -name filename
	
	find . -name -type f \( -name "pattern" -o -name "pattern" \) ---> Incase to find files with multiple conditions
	find . -name -type d \( -name "pattern" -o -name "pattern" \) ---> Incase to find directories with multiple conditions


find path -iname filename

	find . -iname "PaTTern"  ---> Makes a case insensitive search

find path -iname filename*.extension

	find . -iname "PaTTern.extension"  ---> Makes a case insensitive search including file extension

find path -mtime -10  ---> Helps finding the files created with last 10 days
find path -mtime +10  ---> Helps finding the files created Before 10 days

	
find path -mtime -10 -size +300M ---> This command fetches the records that was created with in last 10 days and has filesize more than 300M



find path -mtime -10 -size +300M | grep aws
find . -type f -name a* -print





Filters:

Combination of multiple commands

pipe | (define multiple commands and get a single result)
more - Display the result page by page
less - Display the result page by page but can be navigated through line no

	ls -l | more

wc -l, -c, -w
	cat filename | wc

tr  - Convert from one format to another
	ls -l | tr -s "[a-z]" "[A-Z]"



grep - Searching pattern

	- Accepts regular expressions to find the result

	cat filename | grep "regex"

	cat filename | grep "^s"  ---> Prints all the words starting with the letter "s"
	cat filename | grep "d$"  ---> Prints all the words ending with d
	cat filename | grep "^s" | wc -l
