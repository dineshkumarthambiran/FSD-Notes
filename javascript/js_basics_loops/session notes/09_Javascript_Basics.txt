Java Script:

	Learning objectives:

		- JS fundamentals

What is JS?

	- One of most popular and widely used programming languages in the world
	- Used in Front end and backend as well
	- Prev used in the browser only but now complete apps can be created with JS

Where does JS Run?
	
	- Can run in JS Engines
	- Can run with node server as well

What is JS and ECMA Script?

	- JS is a language and ECMA is a consortium that standardized JS

System Setup:

	- Install node if want to run JS as a standalone app
		- To run a js pgm ===> node index.js
	- Or any browser can run the JS code


console.log('Hello world');
alert('Hello world');

- In an html file JS can be added in two different ways:

	- First way to use the <script></script>
		<script>
			console.log('Hello world');
		</script>

	- Use a seperate file for JS (SOC - Seperation of Concern)


Variables:

	- In JS the variables can be created with the var and let keywords
	- var allows the redeclaration of variables - Which may lead to confusion
	- let restrics the recreation of the variables

Static vs dynamic typed languages:

	- Statically typed languages ---> Java, C# etc ---> Once variable declared of a particular type can't be changed again to a different type

types available in Java script are:

primitive types: 

string
number
boolean
undefined
null: Object

Reference types:

Object:
	- Consists of complex data items inside
	let person = {
		"sid":"123",
		"sname":"Vignesh",
		"city":"Chennai"
	}

	console.log(person.sname);
		or
	console.log(person['sname']);



	course ---> courseid, coursename, deptname
	

Array:
	- Is a collection of items
	- Can be access using the index
	- Array is also an object in Java script

Control structures:

	- The statements that can change the normal flow of a program is called control structure

	Types:

		- Conditional constructs (if else, if else if, nested if..., switch case)
		- Looping statements
		    - To do a task again and again
	
			- for loop 	(When you know the total number of execution)
			- while loop	(When the loop has to execute until a condition is failing)
			- do while	(When you want to execute the loop atleast once)


		for loop:

			- for(initialization; condition; reinitiliazation){
				//body of the loop
			  }

		while loop:

			  initialization;
			  while(condition){
				reinitialization;
			  }
